## About the project

This is the front end for the News Explorer project, the final project in Tripleten's software engineering program. The app was created using Create React App. Using the search form, a user can make a call to a third-party news API which returns a list of news items related to the search query. The project is responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile dimensions.

## Technologies Used

- Semantic HTML/CSS3 for site layout
- Media queries for most screen sizes

## Potential Improvements

- Interactivity with back-end server data
