## About the project

This is the front end for the News Explorer project, the final project in Tripleten's software engineering program. The app was created using Create React App. Using the search form, a user can make a call to a third-party news API which returns a list of news items related to the search query. User authentication/authorization is implemented so logged-in users can bookmark articles to save them to their personal page. The project is responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile dimensions. The front end app is deployed and hosted on Google Cloud, and interacts with the back-end server (see below for link to repo) for authentication/authorization and data management.
